Overview
This project is a simple web page that mirrors some of the core design features of the Amazon home page. The page includes a header with a logo, search bar, and navigation options, a hero section with a promotional message, and a product section displaying different categories like "Health and Personal Care."

The website is designed to demonstrate responsive design techniques using basic HTML and CSS without JavaScript for interactivity. This project is intended for learning purposes and is not affiliated with Amazon in any way.

Note: This project is still under development. More features and refinements are being added continuously.

Features
Responsive Navbar: A navigation bar with links, a search bar, and icons that adapt to different screen sizes.
Hero Section: A full-width image banner with a promotional message.
Product Categories: Featured products displayed in styled boxes with images and category names.
Hover Effects: Simple hover effects on interactive elements like buttons and images.
Technologies Used
HTML5: For the structure and layout of the webpage.
CSS3: For styling and layout, including Flexbox for positioning and responsiveness.
FontAwesome: For the icons used in the navbar (shopping cart, location pin, etc.).
